    <p>The Healing Center of Cincinnati helps people in times of need by providing groceries, job placement and much more. The site redesign involved a good amount of client interaction and input.</p>

    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p>The Healing Center was in need of an updated site that matched the spirit of the organization and worked responsively. The prior site appeared dated and was a burden on the staff to manage and update.</p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>   
    <p>This project consisted of a discovery phase, design and development. I carried out the entire project which spanned 9 months and resulted in the responsive design and development of the site. The site includes a custom CMS build and a Spanish to English toggle (currrently waiting on Spanish translation of content) and many additional features. 
    </p>
    <p>
    At project completion, the site checked in at just under 10,000 lines of code, an improvement of over 100,000 which will make for a much more maintainable site down the road. 99% of the content is also editable through the custom built CMS.</p>
