    <p>This website was created as part of a yearly outreach program done by Vineyard Cincinnati. Thousands of free bottles of water were handed out with "smallthingsgreatlove.com" printed on them. The website is meant to serve as a place for more information as well as a place to share stories.</p>

    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p>smallthingsgreatlove.com was in need of a re-design. The site was very outdated in appearance and did not offer clear enough content and site architecture to be very useful. The original site was also created before smartphones or modern browsers. A responsive, engaging, well structured hierarchy was the overarching goal.</p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>
    
    <p>This project consisted of a discovery phase, design and development. I carried out the entire project which spanned 9 months and resulted in the responsive design and development of the site. The site includes a custom CMS build and a Spanish to English toggle (currrently waiting on Spanish translation of content) and many additional features. 
    </p>
    <p>
    At project completion, the site checked in at just under 10,000 lines of code, an improvement of over 100,000 which will make for a much more maintainable site down the road. 99% of the content is also editable through the custom built CMS.</p>

    <p>A custom admin build was created to review stories submitted and add them to the site. The CMS performs CRUD operations through object-oriented PHP with a MYSQL database.</p>
